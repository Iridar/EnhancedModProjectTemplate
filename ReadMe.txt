ATTENTION!!!

You must perform first time setup before you can begin working on your mod.

To do so, run "RUN_THIS.bat" in the mod project folder.

If you did not close Modbuddy, you will get a popup message about files being modified outside the source editor. Click "Yes to All".

That is all.

Important!!!

When you create the mod project, project Name, Solution name and Title must match *exactly*. Otherwise the first time setup will fail.
